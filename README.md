# Hello!
In this repository I am documenting my personal projects in the field of machine learning, 
specifically analysis and prediction of time series. 
To carry out these projects, the following tools were used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, arima, tensorflow, sklearn, pytorch and keras.
